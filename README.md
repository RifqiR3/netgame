# NetGame

This project is a web platform designed to provide detailed information about video games, similar to a site like Steam. The website uses ChromeDriver and Selenium with PHP to scrape data from various sources, ensuring comprehensive and up-to-date content. Additionally, it leverages the RapidAPI service to search for games, offering users an intuitive way to discover and explore game details. The project aims to create a centralized hub for gamers to find information, reviews, and other relevant content about their favorite games.

## Getting Started

First, to start the development server use laragon or xampp

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Second, use this command to start the chromedriver:
```bash
  chromedriver --port=4444
```

PS: This version of chromedriver only supports Google Chrome Ver.113
